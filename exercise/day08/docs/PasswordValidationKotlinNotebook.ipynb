    "\n",
    "- Contains at least 8 characters\n",

    "\n",
    "- Write production code only to pass a failing unit test.\n",
    "- Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures).\n",
    "- Write no more production code than necessary to pass the one failing unit test.\n",

    "    🔴 Write a failing test\n",
    "    🟢 Make the test pass\n",
    "    🔵 Refactor your code\n",

    "The magic will continue to work only with one condition:\n",
    "**if at any time, your tests are not passing, you need to revert your latest change.**\n",
    "\n",
