// - Contains at least one capital letter
// - Contains at least one lowercase letter
// - Contains at least a number
// - Contains at least a special character in this list `. * # @ $ % &`.
// - Any other characters are not authorized.
// The TDD rules are quite simple:
//
//    - Write production code only to pass a failing unit test.
//    - Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures).
//    - Write no more production code than necessary to pass the one failing unit test.
//
//A gentle reminder, the steps to use the TDD magic can be applied this way:
//
//    ðŸ”´ Write a failing test
//    ðŸŸ¢ Make the test pass
//    ðŸ”µ Refactor your code
//The magic will continue to work only with one condition:
//**if at any time, your tests are not passing, you need to revert your latest change.**
